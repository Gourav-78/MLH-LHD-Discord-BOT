# MLH-LHD-Discord-BOT
A simple bot to reply to 'hello' and also send motivational quotes

It greets users with a message when enconters a string starting with 'hello'. It also sends motivational quotes when encounters a string starting with 'motivate'

It is created using python and hosting it on replit. The replit server keeps it running for one hour from the last interaction time. In order to overcome this I have used UptimeRobot that pings the replit server every 5 minutes to keep the bot active all the time.
